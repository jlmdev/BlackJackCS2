### Problem

- [ ] Create a deck of 52 standard playing cards
- [ ] House to be dealt 2 cards hidden from the player until house reveals hand
- [ ] Deal the player 2 cards, visible to the player
- [ ] The player should have a chance to hit until they decide to stop or they bust. At which point they lose regardless of the dealer's hand
- [ ] When the player stands, the house reveals its hand and hits until they have 17 or more
- [ ] If dealer goes over 21, the dealer loses
- [ ] The player should have 2 choices, hit and stand
- [ ] Consider Aces to always be worth 11, never 1
- [ ] The app should display the winner. For this mode, the winner is the one who gets closest to 21 without going over
- [ ] Ties go to the dealer
- [ ] There should be an option to play again.
- [ ] The cards should be shuffled at the start of each new game
